# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Neural-Network
It is a project for the detection of the brain tumor from the image file. Here we use Residual neural network(RESNET) for detection purpose. It has various preprocessing steps such as greyscale conversion, calculate the image threshold etc. In the preprocessing we had to remove noise as well as find the extreme points. The neural network has 11,137 parameters. Our model reaches the accuracy of above 73%.
